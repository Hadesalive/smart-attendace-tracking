Next Steps

- Verify student course inheritance using real program/year/semester data.
- Seed or confirm `course_assignments` for all active programs.
- Create a few sessions per inherited course to validate section-filtering.
- QA student pages: FilterBar behavior, session lists, attendance records.
- Remove or reduce verbose console logs after validation.
- Add unit/integration tests for `fetchStudentAttendanceSessions` and course mapping.
- Document the enrollment model (program â†’ course assignments; sections for delivery).
